Summer BootCamp
=============

Twitter's Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) in a one-page WordPress theme, designed for use by summer camps. Throughout development, a sample site using the theme can be viewed at http://development.lesliebass.com.

Summary as of 4/1/2013
-------------
Summer BootCamp brings to the table:

+ Responsive design thanks to Bootstrap
+ One-page site is ideal for landing pages and simple informational sites
+ Animated navigation scroll
+ Theme options panel to add your camp's logo
+ Custom web fonts & imagery

What to expect
-------------
In future iterations, I plan to add:

+ Theme options to upload your photos as page backgrounds
+ Contact template with Google maps integration
